 * Custom Battle Intro
 * Version 1.00
 * SumRndmDde
 * 
 * 
 * Allows you to customize your own random encounter battle intro!
 *
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * Basic Options (Parameters)
 * ==========================================================================
 * 
 * == Hide Characters == 
 * Set this to 'true' or 'false' depending on whether or not you wish for
 * the character events to disappear on the map while the transition is 
 * occuring.
 *
 * 
 * == Use Zoom Formula? == 
 * By default, RPG Maker MV uses a formula to set the scale of a zoom 
 * throughout the duration of the battle intro.
 * Set this to 'true' if you wish to use one and you can customize it using
 * the "Zoom Formula" parameter below.
 * Otherwise, set this to 'false'.
 *
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * Frames Explanation
 * ==========================================================================
 * 
 * There are 60 frames in a second.
 * 
 * The default battle intro is 60 frames, or 1 second.
 * 
 * Withing those 60 frames, actions occur at certain frames.
 * 
 * For example, at frame 10 the screen flashes and at frame 30 the battle
 * music starts.
 * 
 * Using this Plugin, you can manipulate what happens in the battle intro
 * by selecting actions to occur at each frame.
 * 
 * You may put one or more actions in each frame and that action will
 * occur at that frame.
 *
